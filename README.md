# TodoMaster

## Overview
TodoMaster is a modern, lightweight todo manager with task tracking and notes. This extension is currently designed for **Firefox only** and uses Manifest V2 APIs.

## Installation (Firefox)
1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in Firefox.
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the `manifest.json` file in this folder.
3. The TodoMaster icon will appear in your toolbar.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete todos
- Track status: pending, ongoing, completed
- Add notes to each todo
- View completed history

## Troubleshooting

### Popup only shows a vertical gradient bar
- This is usually a CSS sizing issue. Make sure both `body` and `.container` use `min-width: 300px` and `min-height: 600px`, and set `height: 600px` for the popup.
- If you see only a thin vertical bar, your popup window is too narrow. Try resizing the popup or check your browser's extension popup settings.
- Check for JavaScript errors in the popup (right-click → Inspect → Console).
- Ensure all required HTML elements are present in `popup.html`.
- After changes, reload the extension in `about:debugging` and reopen the popup.

### Extension doesn't appear in toolbar
- Check if installation was successful in about:debugging
- Try restarting Firefox
- Ensure manifest.json is valid

### Data not persisting
- Check browser storage quota
- Verify Firefox allows local storage
- Try clearing extension data and reload

### UI appears broken
- Hard refresh the popup (close and reopen)
- Check for CSS conflicts
- Verify all files are present

### Performance issues
- Check total number of stored todos
- Consider clearing old history
- Restart Firefox if memory usage is high

## Getting Help
1. Check this README for solutions
2. Look at the browser console for errors
3. Create an issue on GitHub with details
4. Include Firefox version and error messages
